        Hi, I'm looking for somebody who will be able to redesign our system Offeris (see www.offeris.com).<br/>
        Purpose is to modernize design, current looks like old one.<br/>
        Problem is that Offeris has a lot of forms and it's very complicated to change html, mainly tables. So, be so kind and concentrate to css and images. 
        If neccessary, we can add classes to elements but we are not able to change tables to divs.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="quotation/quotation.html">Price Quote list</a></li>
            <li><a href="quotation/quotation_item.html">Price Quote items</a></li>
            <li><a href="quotation/quotation_detail.html">Price Quote detail form</a></li>
            <li><a href="quotation/quotation_edit.html">Price Quote edit form</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If you would need more information, please contact me: biskupic@offeris.online, +421 905 201 177.            
        </p>

            Best regards<br/>
